Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "bac"

Output: 2

Explanation:

For s = "abc" and t = "bac", the permutation difference of s and t is equal to the sum of:

The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "a" in s and the index of the occurrence of "a" in t.
The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "b" in s and the index of the occurrence of "b" in t.
The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "c" in s and the index of the occurrence of "c" in t.
That is, the permutation difference between s and t is equal to |0 - 1| + |1 - 0| + |2 - 2| = 2.



  int an = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<s.size();i++){
            int El = s[i];
            int j = t.find(El);
            an += abs(i-j);
        } 
        return an;
